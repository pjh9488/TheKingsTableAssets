## Game
#### Below is Our Formal Elevator Pitch for The King's Table (All team members contributed to this pitch)
"The King's Table is a cooperative tabletop card game in which two chefs work tirelessly to cook a meal for the king of the realm.
Together, the head chef and sous chef use a cookbook and a wide palette of ingredients to cook dishes and earn stars.
In our target age group of middle school children, cooperation and teamwork are skills that need to be supported in order for proper social development. 
By placing children in a fast-paced environment where they must cooperate to achieve victory, these skills are subtly reinforced while still providing a fun experience for the players. 
With a play time of just six minutes, The Kingâ€™s Table is ideal for many settings, whether it be a parent who is always on-the-go or a teacher with limited time to fit games into their curriculum."

#### Explanation
The King's Table is a 2 player game. The players take the role of the sous chef and the head chef. The sous chef is given all of the ingredients availible in the kitchen.
The head chef is given the menu with the available recipies.
The head chef and the sous chef must work together to prepare a meal for the king.
The challenging part of the game is that the sous chef cannot see the recipies and the head chef cannot see the availible ingredients.

The King's Table was developed specifically to be used in classrooms. This game was meant to be used as a starting point to teach middle school students effective communication and teamwork.

## Notes
I was involved in this game since the we started. I focused mostly on implementing gameplay mechanics to encourage students to communicate effectively.
While I do not identify as an artist, I am very proud of what I produced in this project. I think that what I did opened the door to a solid prototype.
